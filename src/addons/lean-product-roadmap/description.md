Planning ahead with strict yearly or quarterly roadmaps is a waste
of time and resources when working the agile way. Predicting, planning and
committing to your customers beyond a few months ahead is usually a promise
to break.

The Lean product roadmap embraces the lean way of thinking by the Product
Squad, where the team focuses on what is done now, what are the upcoming
priorities based on what is known, and delegation of future ideas into
consideration topics instead of commitments.

One way to accomplish the Lean roadmap is to create a simple board with
three columns: what you are doing NOW (e.g. this quarter),
what you intend to do NEXT (e.g. next quarter),
what are the ideas we have for LATER (e.g. next year).

```
|-----------|------------|-------------|
|    NOW    |    NEXT    |    LATER    |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Mission   | Candidate  | Intention   |
| Mission   | Candidate  | Intention   |
| Mission   | Candidate  |             |
| Mission   |            |             |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
```

An alternative variation to the NOW-NEXT-LATER roadmap is documenting
the active Missions (IN PROGRESS), features to be considered for the next
cycle (UNDER CONSIDERATION), and longshot ideas (LONGSHOTS).

```
|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| IN PROGRESS | UNDER CONSIDERATION | LONGSHOTS |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Mission     | Candidate           | Intention |
| Mission     | Candidate           | Intention |
| Mission     | Candidate           |           |
| Mission     |                     |           |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------|
```

Lean roadmap can be a liberating process for the Product Squad, where items
in these boards are not treated as contracts, and are freely adjusted or modified as cycles
go by, based on new information, customer feedback and new business priorities.
